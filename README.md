# example-intersecting-branches
This is an example of how intersecting branches works. 

# the goal

We want to simulate two teams working in two branches, one of them needs work in progress from the other. 

We don't want to rebase or push force things. 

# the path

   1. Team A creates TeamA.txt file on a new branch teamA
   2. Team B creates TeamB.txt file on a new branch teamB
